I feel lucky to work with my group mates on this project as we are like minded and the project itself is indeed exciting. This project has been an extension to my previous UROP project, and my tasks were the gesture recognition network and the architecture of the drone control system. Overall, we have met our brief and exceeded our most optimistic target in multiple drone control and drone locating system with the webcams. I enjoyed the liberty we had in the projects including that we were allowed to choose the algorithm to recognise gestures, and that we could choose our focus in the project as long as we could justify it. 

The group roles are allocated in the attempt to best meet each member's interest, and this has kept the members highly motivated during most of the project. The progress was slow in the autumn term but rather steady in the spring term. The group coordination was fantastic when doing the drone control part of the project, in that each member were assigned some functions to write, and the functions were pieced together fairly well. 

However, there are several areas that I think we could have done better. Although this project extends from my UROP project, I had limited plans to distribute the tasks for the latter parts of the project. Due to the extensive usage of knowledge not learned in the ME3 course in this project, many tasks requires some background reading. We were lucky that we did not encounter many bottlenecks in this phase of the project, but given another chance, I would spend more time in the first term planning these tasks and ensure the members could read up on relevant materials. Another aspect that we could improve on is the communication between members working on different tasks. Because there are several separate tasks in this project, we have stressed on this since the start of the project. However, the in-depth discussions are still limited, partly because of the background knowledge required in some tasks. For improvement, I think all members should post their progresses on git-hub, even if they are just sketches or draft work, so that the rest of the group could be updated on that part, and ask insightful questions when in doubt.

This project has been a great learning opportunity for me on both group work and technical aspects. In future projects, especially learning projects such as this, I will spend more effort on the planning phase, so that not only time and resources can be allocated well, but also each member could be allocated their favorite task and have sufficient knowledge to complete them.
