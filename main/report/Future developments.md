### Future developments

#### gesture recognition

##### Usage aspect of the armband

calibration between usage for the same user - reinforcement learning

#### drone locating system

##### kinect

larger field of view, faster response, more robust

##### onboard sensors

cameras etc to replace external locating system in the arena, can be used for outdoor application

#### drone control

##### trajectory control instead of location control

more predictable error, more robust

##### non-linearized system, yaw control

allow for more aggressive trajectory planning, suitable for a larger variety of applications
