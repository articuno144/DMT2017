### Discussion and Future developments

#### gesture recognition

good accuracy, result is sensitive to how uniform the calibration data is collected. elaborate++ measures taken:

classification over the duration of the gesture not considered initially be cause it did not occur in UROP. it did occur this time, measures taken to train more aggressively.

##### Usage aspect of the armband

calibration between usage for the same user - reinforcement learning

#### drone locating system

Hovering time 

##### kinect

larger field of view, faster response, more robust

##### onboard sensors

cameras etc to replace external locating system in the arena, can be used for outdoor application

#### drone control

##### trajectory control instead of location control

more predictable error, more robust

##### non-linearized system, yaw control

allow for more aggressive trajectory planning, suitable for a larger variety of applications
